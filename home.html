    <h2>Welcome to My Blog</h2>
    <p> This blog is where I share my favorite hobbies, school life experiences, and things I enjoy doing during my free time. I like exploring creative ideas and learning new skills. </p>

    <p>I created this website as part of a web design task and also as a way to express my interests. You will find blog posts, images, and personal stories across the pages.</p>
